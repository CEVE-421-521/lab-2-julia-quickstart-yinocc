# Raw data

This folder contains raw data used for the labs.
It comes from the [NOAA Tides and Currents API](https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/responseHelp.html).
**You should never edit raw data**.
Instead, keep the raw data you have in a separate folder and write (and save) the code you use to process and transform it.
Sometimes (not for this lab) you'll want to save your intermediate data files for convenience, but you should always be able to reproduce them from the raw data.
